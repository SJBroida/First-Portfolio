        <h2>Welcome to my Online Portfolio!</h2>
        <p>I am a software developer who has recently moved to Adrian, MI.</p>
        <p>I'm eager to get started in the Full Immersion Software Engineering Cohort at Thinkful and am excited to enter a new career.</p>

      <article id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I graduated from the Rochester Institute of Technology with a Bachelor's of Science Degree in 2006.  I majored in Information Technology, but found a challenging job market with few opportunities.  I became skilled in technical support, working in the support field for several years, but always believed I could do more.</p>
        <p>This was what eventually led me to Thinkful.</p>
        <p>Since my programming skills haven't been utilized much since graduating college, and since so much has changed in the world of software engineering, I'm looking forward to getting to meet other people looking to code and work together with them to create amazing projects.</p>
        <p>Outside of programming, I'm also interested in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Video Games</li>
          <li>Japanese Animation, Comics, and Culture</li>
          <li>Science Fiction and Fantasy stories</li>
          <li>Action & Comedy movies</li>
        </ul>
